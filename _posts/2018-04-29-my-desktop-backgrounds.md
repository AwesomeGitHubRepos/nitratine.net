Surprisingly I get a lot of people as where I got my backgrounds from in my [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/PyTutorialsOriginal). I've finally decided to just put them all in once place if anyone is interested.

<!-- more -->

I will also add backgrounds I have made at the top of this and add attributions to where I got other backgrounds from.

## Designed By Me
These are backgrounds I have created myself either for a purpose or just for the interest of how it was created.

### Mass jQuery

I created this image to back my YouTube banner. I used JavaScript as it can be compressed unlike Python and I could easily get plenty of it, for example jQuery as I used in this.

I made a tutorial on creating the background at [{% link _posts/2018-01-24-code-background-in-html.md %}]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2018-01-24-code-background-in-html.md %}) which uses the "Online Pygments Lexer" tool on my old [Nitratine](http://nitratine.pythonanywhere.com/tools/pygments-online) site.

A smaller version for smaller screens can be found [here](/images/my-desktop-backgrounds/mass-jquery-small.png).

## Not Designed by Me
These are the backgrounds that are featured as my background in my YouTube videos.

### Hills Material Design Wallpaper

This is currently my favourite as it is so clean and has a very happy feel to it. Icons site nicely on it and it is very clear being 1920x1080. I found this in a Google Image search but [this is the origin](http://www.baltana.com/abstract/material-design-hd-desktop-wallpaper-23164.html)

### Material Design Blue

You will find I like material design and I used to try and design a lot of my projects to the specifications, this is obviously quite time consuming so I settle for backgrounds, colours and icons.

This was also found by Google Image search but [originated here](http://wallpaperswide.com/material_design-wallpapers.html)

### Fluorescent Face

I really liked the colours in this background. Monitors that render colour well makes this image look amazing. Unfortunately I don't remember where this image came from and a reverse image search is not providing hints by giving me 30 different results at the same resolution.

### LHC Blocks

This image is a representation of some data collected by the LHC. I loved the idea and all the colours of this and the black backing was a bonus. This image was actually an icon for the video ["Heavy Ion collision event display"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzNSME3h9rs) on YouTube.
