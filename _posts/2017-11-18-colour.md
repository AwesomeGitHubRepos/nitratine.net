This app is based off the goal of obtaining all 16,777,216 colours by randomly generating colours when taping the screen. This figure is the amount of colours a screen can display today and it's your challenge to find them all.

## The Idea
One night I was having a chat with a friend on how stupid apps always seem to make it to the top. We started to think of stupid apps and thus this app was born. Based off the simple idea of just tapping the screen to randomly generate colours I managed to turn an idea into an app in a couple of months in between my study.
This idea also made me wonder how long would it actually take to complete an app of this nature for users? The investigation can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-12-07-randomly-generating-numbers-to-fulfil-an-integer-range.md %}).

## The Goal
So the app has a pretty simple goal; find all the colours. Now it may seem that all you have to do is tap the screen 16,777,216 times to finish but colours are randomly generated. This means if you did get to 16,777,215 colours, you would have a 1 in 16,777,216 of finishing.
On the chance that you get two of one colour, you can merge it with another duplicate colour you have in the colour mixer to find another colour.
