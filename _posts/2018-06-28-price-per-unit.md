## Introduction
I really wanted some more practice with the Android SDK so I decided to make something that I would have liked to have.

This app compares prices for similar items and will calculate the price per unit for each item. These values can then be compared to find the best value for money. Simply give a name (optional), enter in the cost, amount and size of each item and the unit per dollar will be calculated.

This app is ideal to find the best price in supermarkets but will work just in well at other stores that sell the same type of items for different prices or you can even compare prices from different stores.
