                    <p>This project was my attempt at making the task of packaging Python scripts to Windows executables to run on computers without Python installed easier for new-comers.</p>
                    <p>This project allows someone to easily set up a server that uses chromes app mode as an interface and then calls PyInstaller with the parameters provided by the user.</p>

                    <p>This project is an Android app that compares prices for similar items and will calculate the price per unit for each item. These values can then be compared to find the best value for money. Simply give a name (optional), enter in the cost, amount and size of each item and the unit per dollar will be calculated.</p>

                    <p>This project fixed my issue of having to re-copy something after I just overwrote my clipboard with something else.</p>
                    <p>It does this by opening a simple GUI that allows you to have temporary clipboards like a hotbar. The package comes with a listener that listens for <code>Ctrl + Windows + C</code> which can be enabled and disabled has an option to be started on startup. For maximum speed, you can simply click a virtual clipboard to put it on your clipboard and it will close (can be turned off). It supports unlimited clipboards and many types of clipboard formats.</p>

                    <p>Emotionify is a webapp that allows users to login to Spotify, select a playlist and then sort them using Spotify's pre-calculated audio feature values.</p>
                    <p>By default, this project aims to create emotionally gradiented Spotify playlists for smoother emotional transitions. It does this by sorting songs based off the two features <code>Valence</code> and <code>Energy</code> <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/">calculated by Spotify</a> based on distance from the origin.</p>
                    <p>Users also have the ability to change how and what songs are sorted by.</p>

                    <p>When I have time and ideas, I like to make programming tutorials. Currently most of my tutorials are Python related but I also have a few different ones.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">Some of my videos have quite a bit of attention, for example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://youtu.be/lOIJIk_maO4">Convert PY to EXE</a>: 430k views</li>
                        <li><a href="https://youtu.be/x8GbWt56TlY">Python Keylogger</a>: 160k views</li>
                        <li><a href="https://youtu.be/ksW59gYEl6Q">Python GUI's with PyQt5</a>: 110k views</li>
                        <li><a href="https://youtu.be/H-6gxvBBEiw">Record Your Computer Screen With VLC</a>: 860k views</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I give a lot of help in the comments for these videos and try my best to find solutions for issues people are having. This also allows me to gauge what people like in terms of topics and the videos themselves and get great feedback.</p>

                    <p>Nitratine is a website where I share projects developed by me and tutorials on topics that I'm interested in. Currently this is the third version of the site and is hosted statically using GitHub Pages and built with a <a href="https://github.com/brentvollebregt/nitratine.net">custom Python build script</a>.</p>
                    <p>When developing and writing posts, the website can be hosted locally using Flask which then changes to be viewed without having to re-build the site on each modification. Posts are written in markdown which are converted to HTML using <a href="https://github.com/Flask-FlatPages/Flask-FlatPages">Flask-FlatPages</a>.</p>
                    <p>Due to the static nature of the site, I use <a href="https://github.com/Frozen-Flask/Frozen-Flask">Frozen-Flask</a> to freeze the site into a static version that can easily be hosted on GitHub pages. A deploy script then commits, tags and pushes all changes on a separate branch.</p>

                    <p>This project allowed me to have a lot of small scripts in one place that is easy to get to.</p>
                    <p>Just like Multi Clipboard, attach this to a hotkey and your scripts you previously added will appear. Example scripts come pre-loaded like saving a clipboard image to a file, restarting windows explorer and putting your ip address on your clipboard.</p>
