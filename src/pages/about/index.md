# About Me

My name is [Brent](https://github.com/brentvollebregt) and I'm a full-time software developer from New Zealand. My preferred language is Python but I also do a lot of development in frontend in my free time and use an assortment of other tech at work.

I own the [PyTutorials](https://www.youtube.com/PyTutorials) channel on YouTube which is where I provide video tutorials on intermediate Python topics.

[Nitratine](/) is a place for me to share projects developed by me and tutorials on topics that I'm interested in. Currently this is the fourth version of the site; it's built using Gatsby and hosted statically using GitHub Pages.

A small [portfolio of my work is linked here](/portfolio/) that contains a collection of my favourite projects I developed with a small description and links to pages relating to the project.

> Basic site statistics and values relating to the things I do can be found at [/data/](/data/).
