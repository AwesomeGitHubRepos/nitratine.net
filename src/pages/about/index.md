My name is [Brent](https://github.com/brentvollebregt) and I'm a full-time software developer from New Zealand. My preferred language is Python but I also do a lot of development in frontend in my free time and use an assortment of other tech at work.

I own the PyTutorials channel on YouTube which is where I provide video tutorials on intermediate Python topics.

Nitratine is a place for me to share projects developed by me and tutorials on topics that I'm interested in. Currently, this is the third version of the site and is hosted statically using GitHub Pages and built with a custom Python build script taking use of Frozen-Flask.

A small portfolio of my work is linked here that contains a collection of my favourite projects I developed with a small description and links to pages relating to the project.

Basic site statistics and values relating to the things I do can be found at /data/.
