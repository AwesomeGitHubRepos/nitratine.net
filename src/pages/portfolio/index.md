      ## [Auto Py To Exe](https://github.com/brentvollebregt/auto-py-to-exe)


      This project was my attempt at making the task of packaging Python scripts to Windows executables to run on computers without Python installed easier for new-comers.


      This project allows someone to easily set up a server that uses chromes app mode as an interface and then calls PyInstaller with the parameters provided by the user.


      TODO: IMAGE


      This project can be installed from PyPI by executing:


      ```cmd

      python -m pip install auto-py-to-exe

      ```


      And then to run the project, simply call:


      ```cmd

      auto-py-to-exe

      ```

      ![Emotionify Logo](/assets/featured-site-emotionify.png)


      Emotionify is a web app that allows users to login to Spotify,
      select a playlist and then sort them using Spotify's pre-calculated audio
      feature values.\r

      \r

      By default, this project aims to create emotionally gradiented
      Spotify playlists for smoother emotional transitions. It does this by
      sorting songs based off the two features `Valence` and `Energy`
      [calculated by
      Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tr\
      acks/get-audio-features/) based on distance from the origin.\r

      \r

      Users also have the ability to change how and what songs are sorted
      by.

      Monopoly Money is a web app that helps you keep track of your
      finances in a game of Monopoly\r

      \r

      Instead of using the cash that the game commonly comes with, you can
      play Monopoly like you're playing the credit card edition, but with your
      phone - a much more faster way to exchange money.

      TODO: IMAGE


      When I have time and ideas, I like to make programming tutorials.
      Currently most of my tutorials are Python related but I also have a few
      different ones.


      Some of my videos have quite a bit of attention, for example:

      - [Convert PY to EXE](https://youtu.be/lOIJIk_maO4): 600K+ views\r

      - [Python GUI's with PyQt5](https://youtu.be/ksW59gYEl6Q): 200k+
      views\r

      - [Python Keylogger](https://youtu.be/x8GbWt56TlY): 150k+ views\r

      - [Record Your Computer Screen With
      VLC](https://youtu.be/H-6gxvBBEiw): 900k+ views\r

      \r

      I give a significant amount of help in the comments for these videos
      and try my best to find solutions for issues people are having. This also
      allows me to gauge what people like in terms of topics and the videos
      themselves and get great feedback.\n"

      This tool helps you keep and eye on who is on your network and when.
      It can periodically scan your network and you can then assign devices to
      people and view who is on your network.\r

      \r

      The tool provides a React interface to view scans that have been
      made and identify unusual and unexpected activity.

      ## [Price Per Unit](https://github.com/brentvollebregt/price-per-unit)


      TODO: IMAGE


      This project is an Android app that compares prices for similar items and will calculate the price per unit for each item. These values can then be compared to find the best value for money. Simply give a name (optional), enter in the cost, amount and size of each item and the unit per dollar will be calculated.

      TODO: CHANGE BELOW


      Nitratine is a website where I share projects developed by me and
      tutorials on topics that I'm interested in. Currently this is the third
      version of the site and is hosted statically using GitHub Pages and built
      with a custom Python build script.\r

      \r

      When developing and writing posts, the website can be hosted locally
      using Flask which then changes to be viewed without having to re-build the
      site on each modification. Posts are written in markdown which are
      converted to HTML using Flask-FlatPages.\r

      \r

      Due to the static nature of the site, I use Frozen-Flask to freeze
      the site into a static version that can easily be hosted on GitHub pages.
      A deploy script then commits, tags and pushes all changes on a separate
      branch."
