      This project was my attempt at making the task of packaging Python
      scripts to Windows executables to run on computers without Python
      installed easier for new-comers.\r

      \r

      This project allows someone to easily set up a server that uses
      chromes app mode as an interface and then calls PyInstaller with the
      parameters provided by the user.


      TODO: IMAGE


      This project can be installed from PyPI by executing:\r

      \r

      ```cmd

      python -m pip install auto-py-to-exe

      \r```


      And then to run the project, simply call:\r

      \r

      ```cmd

      auto-py-to-exe

      ```

      TODO: IMAGE


      Emotionify is a web app that allows users to login to Spotify,
      select a playlist and then sort them using Spotify's pre-calculated audio
      feature values.\r

      \r

      By default, this project aims to create emotionally gradiented
      Spotify playlists for smoother emotional transitions. It does this by
      sorting songs based off the two features `Valence` and `Energy`
      [calculated by
      Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tr\
      acks/get-audio-features/) based on distance from the origin.\r

      \r

      Users also have the ability to change how and what songs are sorted
      by.
