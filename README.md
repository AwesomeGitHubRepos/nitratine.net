Based off https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms

## TODO

- Add `gatsby-plugin-feed`

### Launch

- CMS backend
- Remove robots
- `UA-117153268-6` => `UA-117153268-2`
- Enabled AdSense and `static.useInternalLinking`=`non-post-associations`

### Not Required (after launch)

- MEDIUM: Query typings throughout
- BUG: Some images aren't linked to original
- SMALL: Put actual react-bootstrap components in
- Make something to identify 404s
- Group tags/categories/years at top of category pages as links to headers (with numbers) e.g. taga (2) tagb (5) tagc (8)
- Blog footer? Need to link category pages somehow
- SMALL: Add switch to disable ads on particular pages
- MAYBE: Create a language on top of python that allows for some extra tokens?
- DEBT: Figure out what to do with the `useAdSenseAutoAds` situation
