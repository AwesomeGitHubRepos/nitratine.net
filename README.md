Based off https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms

## Broken

- Some images aren't clickable

- To JS: javascript-date-methods-return-values

### Small

- use Gatsby links
- put actual react-bootstrap components in

### Large

- Use image sharp to blur in images:
  - Header logo
  - Home featured post images (and top logo)
  - Blog feed images
  - About experience with images
- Use remark custom components to remove the need for the YouTube video in the frontmatter?
- Headers + icons
- redirects
- Mocking old style sheet for code
- Google AdSense
  - Approval for a test site
- /data/ page
- Make something to identify 404s

### Check if post is in-tack / alter

- Convert JavaScript date time post to jsx

### Add

- Group tags/categories/years at top of category pages as links to headers (with numbers) e.g. taga (2) tagb (5) tagc (8)
- Blog footer? Need to link category pages somehow
- Add switch to disable ads on particular pages
