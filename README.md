# Nitratine.net

Based off https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms

## Broken

- Some images aren't linked to original

### Small

- put actual react-bootstrap components in

### Large

- redirects
- Mocking old style sheet for code
- Post comments
- Google Analytics
- Google AdSense (enable and test - need approval for the test site to test on test.nitratine.net)
- Remove robots
- Remove source maps

### Add

- Make something to identify 404s
- Group tags/categories/years at top of category pages as links to headers (with numbers) e.g. taga (2) tagb (5) tagc (8)
- Blog footer? Need to link category pages somehow
- Add switch to disable ads on particular pages
