## Broken

- Some images aren't linked to original

### Small

- use Gatsby links
- put actual react-bootstrap components in

### Large

- Use image sharp to blur in images:
  - About experience with images
  - Sidebar recent videos
  - Sidebar featured sites
- Headers + icons
- redirects
- Mocking old style sheet for code
- Google AdSense
  - Approval for a test site
- /data/ page

### Add

- Make something to identify 404s
- Group tags/categories/years at top of category pages as links to headers (with numbers) e.g. taga (2) tagb (5) tagc (8)
- Blog footer? Need to link category pages somehow
- Add switch to disable ads on particular pages
