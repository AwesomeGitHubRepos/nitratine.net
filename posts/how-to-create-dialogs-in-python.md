## Why Are Dialogs Useful?

## Dialog Types and Their Returns
- Each dialog does something different and returns something different
- Understanding what each method returns, as well as what it returns when nothing is selected is necessary for using these.
- Required parent

### Message Dialogs

### Question Dialogs

### Input Dialogs

### File / Folder Dialogs

### Colour Picker Dialog

## Credit 
While using a lot of dialogs in my own projects I have always looked around other sites, but recently I found a page called [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Interactive Edition](https://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/CS152f17/GUIandEventDrivenProgramming/02_standard_dialog_boxes.html) which is a great beginner level tutorial for Python which covers many things. This site made me aware of some dialogs I didn't even realise existed so I give credit to the creator.

## TODO
- Include pictures!
- Put an icon on the parent?
